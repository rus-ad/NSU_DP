# NSU Community Structure Study

## Description
Each person can be characterized by a wide attribute space. This could be the history of his publications on the Internet, data from medical sources, or something else. In my work, I tried to identify leaders and groups of various levels of association based on the musical preferences of my friends on social networks.
The main source of data is the social network VKontakte.

Project structure:
- parser - data delivery implementation;
- report - list of articles that are planned to be implemented someday;
- modelling - train models and visualize results.
